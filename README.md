# Lezard-Client
The Lezard Client will be a new, open-source, minecraft client for the newer versions of the game. It is oriented not for PvP, but for the Vanilla and the Survival experience. **It is not a hack client for Minecraft and do not ask for it**. First i hate hacked client and 2 it is not fun for other people.

# Why ?
I fall in love with Java programming and i love the game Minecraft. I want to make Minecraft as good as possible, with GUIs, optimizations, QOL features and other. I wanted a client for the latest versions of Minecraft but it is complicated, every client are on 1.8.9, the only good client i found in 1.18 is the feather client but first it is not stable and do you want to pay 15$ ? The second thing is that you are not sure that if the client steal your minecraft account and thats why i made my launcher and the client open-source ( even if a key logger should be in the launcher ). You can use the code of the launcher for you own use, for learn how to make a client ( im not the best example ), for see how i made something  or other. Just dont share the unmodified code and say that you made it.

# Updates
I dont want to update it for the 1.19 for now because the mcp is not out yet and i think there will be more players in 1.18 than in 1.19 so no plan for now

# How to use it ?
Im currently working on a launcher for it. For now idk
