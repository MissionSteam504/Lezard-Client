# Lezard-Client
The Lezard Client will be a new, open-source, minecraft client for the newer versions of the game. It is oriented not for PvP, but for the Vanilla and the Survival experience.

# Editing the source code
Lezard Client use MCP-Reborn so you have to generate the Minecraft source code. 
But if you want to edit the client code, make a copy of the *src* folder, generate the code and then paste the src folder again. 
With that, the client code is not deleted by the MCP. Because this is a generated Minecraft code, nothing about the client appear inside so the majority of what we code is inside the fr.lezard package.
